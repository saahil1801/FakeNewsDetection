Detecting fake news is a critical application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). This project leverages Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks to identify fake news articles based on their textual content.

The primary goal of this project is to develop an AI/ML-based fake news detector, which plays a vital role in discerning the authenticity of news articles automatically. This technology has wide-ranging applications in various industries, including media and journalism, to combat the spread of misinformation.
